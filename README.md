# Quiz App built with React
This is a demo quiz app built with React, Chakra UI and Firebase as Backend.

**Build Time**: < 8 Hours
**Host**: Netlify

Please note that this used a typescript template of Chakra UI. I don't work with Typescript very often and due to lack of time, I didn't declare types everywhere

# Quiz App built with React
This is a demo quiz app built with React, Chakra UI and Firebase as Backend.

**Build Time**: < 8 Hours

**Hosted on**: https://9q21e1.csb.app/

Questions available only in Class 6 - Math, Science, History. 

Please note that this used a typescript template of Chakra UI. I don't work with Typescript very often and due to lack of time, I didn't declare types everywhere
